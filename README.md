# Roll-the-Dice-
This is a personal project for me to test my skills in Node-Js and Express Js as well as in front end part of the website



## Instructions:
First ensure that nodejs is installed in your system.
I used the Command Prompt to run this project.
For Mac, it is different.

## Working:
From the place where the project resides, open the Command Prompt.
Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the required packages

``bash
npm inint
``
Install expressjs.

``bash
npm install express
``
Install nodemon  // This is to ensure that server can run even if you make changes in the file.

``bash
npm install -g nodemon
``
Run the app.js file.

Open LocalHost:3000 in your browser.
There You Go.
